18/09/2018;France's Lactalis gets go-ahead to reopen plant after tainted milk scandal;"PARIS, Sept 18 (Reuters) -
French authorities have given
dairy giant Lactalis permission
to resume selling baby milk from a factory
that was closed after salmonella contaminated
milk produced there infected
dozens of babies, the government
said on Tuesday.
Lactalis, one of the world’s largest dairy
groups, had to recall 12 million tins in
France and around the world because of
the contamination, in a scandal that hit
the reputation of France's agri-business
industry.
""Conditions are now met to allow the
sale of infant milk powder,"" the Agriculture
Ministry said in a statement.
The decision comes days after Lactalis
agreed to buy the infant formula business
of South African drugmaker Aspen
Pharmacare for 12.9 billion rand ($865
million) in an effort to revive its baby
milk expansion after the scandal.
Lactalis has carried out tests at the plant
in the northwestern town of Craon for
more than three months under the supervision
of French health authorities,
which will carry out regular, unannounced
inspections at the plant in the
future.
Privately owned Lactalis, which has
said the crisis could cost it hundreds of
million of euros, had said that the production
line linked to the contamination
would be closed permanently but it was
awaiting permission from French authorities
to restart output at its other production
line.
Lactalis could not immediately be
reached for comment on Tuesday.

JOHANNESBURG, Sept 13 (Reuters) -
Aspen Pharmacare has agreed to sell its
infant formula business to Lactalis for
12.9 billion rand ($865 million) to focus
on core activities while the French buyer
looks to revive its baby milk expansion
after a health scandal.
Investors in the South African drugmaker
appeared unimpressed, however, after
expectations that the deal could top $1
billion. The company's share price tumbled
after the deal's announcement on
Thursday alongside full-year earnings,
dropping 26 percent before paring losses
to stand 16.3 percent down at 228.06
rand by 1430 GMT.
Rising incomes in emerging markets
coupled with global population growth
have made infant formula an attractive
proposition in a market dominated by
Nestle, Danone and Reckitt Benckiser,
which acquired Mead Johnson of the
United States last year.
""The market expected Aspen to get $1
billion to $1.5 billion dollars,"" Cratos
Capital equity trader Greg Davies said,
adding that there is also some doubt
over Aspen's stated growth expectations.
FNB Wealth and Investments portfolio
manager Wayne McCurrie said a ""second
disappointment"" concerned Aspen's
rising debt levels and whether Africa's
biggest manufacturer of generic drugs
had been forced to sell the infant milk
business to reduce gearing levels.
""The market is worried that they took
a decision just on debt and not on the
growth prospects of the business, because
this business looked quite good,""
McCurrie said.
""They were pumping it massively over
the last year or so and all of a sudden say
they are selling it.""
Aspen CEO Stephen Saad said the disposal
was in line with ""our strategic intention
to focus attention on our core
pharmaceutical business, which includes the anesthetics, thrombosis and
high potency and cytotoxic portfolios.""
After 1.1 billion rand to be paid to partners
in Asia-Pacific, Aspen will receive
11.8 billion rand, representing 23 times
the unit's earnings of 512 million rand,
Deputy Chief Executive Gus Attridge
said.
CHANCE TO REBUILD
For Lactalis, meanwhile, the deal represents
an opportunity to rebuild its baby
milk business after a salmonella outbreak
at its production site in northwest
France caused dozens of babies to fall
sick and led to a global product recall.
Lactalis is the world's largest dairy firm,
with annual sales of 18.4 billion euros
($21.4 billion), but baby milk has been
a relatively small part of its activities
and is now at a standstill after the health
scare.
The company's head of communications,
Michel Nalet, said the production
halt in France was ""one of the factors""
behind the move for the Aspen business
""In infant formula, we didn't have a base
outside France. We had the desire to be
a global player in all dairy businesses,""
he said.
Aspen's nutritionals business sells infant
milk formula in the Asia-Pacific region,
sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America,
and has been building a growing presence
in the Middle East and China.
Privately owned Lactalis, which said the
crisis could cost it hundreds of million
of euros, decided the production line
linked to the contamination should be
closed permanently and is now awaiting
permission from French authorities to
restart output at its other production
line.
The acquisition will be funded with
cash, Aspen said, adding that the proceeds
will reduce its debt and that the
deal is expected to close in the next six
months.
Lactalis will also receive any intellectual
property and goodwill presently
owned by Aspen Holdings and Pharmacare
Ltd and Aspen Global Incorporated.
Aspen's infant formula business contributed
3.1 billion rand to group revenue
in the year to June 30.
The drugmaker posted full-year normalized
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization of 12 billion
rand, up 5 percent, helped by strong
growth in China, inclusion of anesthetics
portfolios acquired the previous year
and positive organic growth in commercial
pharmaceuticals.

per share, up 10 percent. ($1 = 0.8601

Latin America, Africa, Australia and
Asia.
Aspen said earlier on Thursday that it
was selling the business to Lactalis for

Lactalis said the acquisition should take
effect during the first quarter of 2019,

France should appoint a ""food
safety police"" and increase
fines on those who sell contaminated
products to avoid a repeat of the salmonella
outbreak at a Lactalis milk factory
last year that led to dozens of babies
falling ill, lawmakers said.
Lactalis, the world's largest dairy group,
had to recall more than 12 million tins
of baby milk in France and around the
world due to the outbreak, in a scandal
that hit the reputation of France's strategic
agri-business industry in overseas
markets.
France's National Assembly launched a
special enquiry into the scandal, which
deepened when errors in the massive
product recall left some potentially contaminated
baby milk on shop shelves.
In their findings, lawmakers recommended
tougher judicial and financial
sanctions against food makers in case
they sell a contaminated product.
""Those who do not play by the rules
must suffer the consequences: criminal
and financial sanctions that will be
much more important than the current
ones,"" said Gregory Besson-Moreau,
head of the committee.
The sanctions would be in relation to
company turnover, rather than be fixed
amounts, he said.
He also suggested imposing a fee on
food producers to finance state-run inspections,
something that has been allowed
by the European Union.
This could raise 270 million euros per
year, and lead to the creation of 800 jobs
in a new ""food safety police"" reporting
to the farm minister, he said.
Farmers would be excluded from the additional
tax.
Food inspections in France are currently
split between three administrations -
economy, food and health -, which has
created gaps and confusions in previous
crises.
Between early April and mid-June the
enquiry committee into the Lactalis affair
held 35 hearings, questioning the
ministers involved, Lactalis Chief Executive
Emmanuel Besnier, CEOs and senior
managers of France's biggest retail
chains, unions and inspection officials.
Lactalis declined to comment on the report
but said it would respect any new
regulations.
Improved checks and consumer information
were also necessary given a risk
of ""food terrorism"" - deliberate contamination
or poisoning - the French lawmakers
said.
In a separate report handed to Economy
Minister Bruno Le Maire on Tuesday, a consumer affairs body stressed the need
to review the product recall process in
France.
Le Maire took up their proposal to use
clients' bank details to identify and contact
people who bought suspicious products
and agreed to create a system that
would bloc recalled products at checkouts.
He also announced the launch of a single
internet website to gather information
in case of a health crisis. (Reporting

07/06/2018;Grilled by French MPs, Lactalis defends handling of baby milk crisis;"* CEO appears before French parliamentary
hearing
* Says group took all steps once salmonella
outbreak known
* Lawmakers criticise firm's secrecy in
tense exchange
By Sybille de La Hamaide and Gus
Trompiz
PARIS, June 7 (Reuters) - The contamination
of baby milk with salmonella at a
Lactalis factory in France last year was
an accident and the dairy group took the
necessary steps to prevent more babies
falling ill, the company's CEO told lawmakers
in a rare public appearance.
Lactalis, the world's largest dairy group,
recalled millions of tins of baby milk in
France and around the world, and halted
production at its Craon plant in northwest
France after dozens of babies fell
ill last year due to drinking salmonellacontaminated
milk.
The scandal, which deepened when errors
in the massive product recall left
some potentially contaminated baby
milk on shop shelves, fuelled criticism
of poor communication by Lactalis,
which is privately held by the Besnier
family.
In a sometimes tense exchange with
members of a parliamentary committee
investigating the contamination, softly
spoken Chief Executive Emmanuel
Besnier apologised for the distress
caused to families but defended his
group's safety record.
""Regarding the handling of the crisis,
I think at each stage we took the necessary
measures to ensure that no baby
would fall ill in relation to our products,""
Besnier, said on Thursday to the
committee of lawmakers from France's
National Assembly.
Lactalis reiterated previous comments
that tests of its products had not shown
any salmonella prior to the recall and
that the contamination was linked to
work in the factory that released bacteria
hidden in the structure of the building.
""It was an accident, no one is responsible
for this at the factory,"" Besnier, 47,
who appeared alongside four other senior
Lactalis managers, said.
The cases of babies falling sick were all
before the start of the product recall on
Dec. 2, 2017, which Lactalis triggered
as soon as it was informed by the authorities
of a link to its Craon factory, he
said. ""It is not the contamination that is on a
large scale, it is the product recall,"" he
said.
The CEO's comments irritated several
lawmakers who said the group failed to
explain fully the events and had understated
the seriousness of the crisis.
""When you feed many of the world's
children it is your duty to communicate,""
Gregory Besson-Moreau, the parliamentary
committee's rapporteur, said
after the hearing.
""You can't change a culture of secrecy
within a few weeks. I hope they are going
to try harder.""
The parliamentary committee is due to
publish a report in July. A separate judicial
inquiry is also continuing into the
salmonella outbreak.
Lactalis said last week it was testing
production again at its Craon plant with
a view to restarting output.
The group has permanently closed the
production line linked to the salmonella
outbreak. It has also said it will now use
two external testing firms for products
made at Craon, after tests by its existing
partner failed to detect last year's contamination.
In February, Besnier said Lactalis could
have been producing salmonella-tainted
baby milk at Craon since 2005. The crisis
was likely to cost the company hundreds
of millions of euros, he said.";Reuters

French company at the centre
of an international baby milk
scandal denied Thursday that it was responsible
for the contamination that
triggered a recall of formula in over 80
countries, calling it ""an accident"".
Lactalis, one of the world's biggest dairy
groups, was forced to recall 12 million
packages of powdered baby milk in 83
countries in December and January after
being linked to an outbreak of salmonella
poisoning in children.
French officials began investigating the
company after at least 36 infants fell
sick from drinking milk sold under the
Picot or Milumel brands. Cases of suspected
contamination were also reported
among children in Spain and Greece.
The outbreak was traced to a Lactalis
factory in Craon, western France.
CEO Emmanuel Besnier told a French
parliamentary inquiry that a renovation
of the plant in early 2017 ""released salmonella
which was inside the buildings"".
""It was an accident. Nobody inside the
factory was responsible,"" he told lawmakers.

after it emerged that the company's own
tests found salmonella on a production
line but that it did not report the finding

Salmonella causes fever and diarrhoea
in infants, along with vomiting in some
cases, which can lead to babies being
hospitalised for dehydration.
According to French health authorities,
all of the babies sickened by the Lactalis
milk made a good recovery.
Production at the Lactalis plant has been
suspended over the scare.
Researchers from the Pasteur Institute in
Paris have since said they suspect the
factory of being behind at least 25 other
cases of salmonella poisoning between
2006 and 2016.

step,"" he said.
The plant had been halted since December
after discovering the contamination
in baby milk produced in the production

shut due to the outbreak.
None of the products made at the plant
will be sold on the market before farm

French retailers, defending
their role in a contaminated baby
milk scandal on Wednesday, said
they had received products after the recall
deadline and that communication by
dairy producer Lactalis was confusing.
Lactalis, one of the world's largest dairy
groups, recalled 12 million tins in
France and around the world after babies
were taken ill last year after drinking
salmonella-contaminated milk produced
at a factory in western France.
Representatives from retailers Carrefour,
Casino , Leclerc, Intermarche,
Auchan, Systeme U and Cora, speaking
at a hearing of the French Senate's Economic
Affairs Committee on the health
scare on Wednesday, did however admit
to some responsibility for products remaining
on their store shelves.
Several families and consumer associations
have filed complaints against Lactalis
and retailers over the scandal,
which also threatens to damage the reputation
of France's strategic agribusiness
industry in overseas markets.
Retailers said Lactalis had delivered recalled
products after the date when they
should have been removed from the
market.
Auchan's Secretary General Franck
Geretzhuber said that after the Dec. 21
recall, Auchan received a delivery of the
Lactalis products affected by the recall
on Dec. 29 while Dufort said Lactalis
products were delivered to Carrefour on
Dec. 14 even though they had been recalled
on Dec. 10.
Lactalis was not immediately available
to comment.
Some of the retailers, including Carrefour,
Leclerc and Auchan admitted to
human errors after some Lactalis products
that had been returned by clients
found their way back on to store shelves.
All retailers however pointed to confused
and slow communication from
Lactalis.
""Our processes were robust but destabilised
by the erratic communication of
our supplier, who multiplied unclear
messages,"" Casino's head of external
communications Claude Risac said.
Leclerc, Auchan, Carrefour, Casino and
Systeme U have all acknowledged that
some of the baby milk remained on their
shelves after the recall that began in early
December.
Two complaints by families are already
targeting Auchan and Leclerc. ""At Carrefour, the fault comes from
poor management of the products returned
to the stores by clients,"" Carrefour's
head of quality Stephane Dufort
told the committee.
Salmonella infections can be lifethreatening
and the families of three
dozen children who have fallen sick in
France as a result of the contaminated
baby milk have announced a raft of lawsuits.

French dairy group Lactalis,
which is facing a growing
scandal over salmonella-tainted baby
milk, did not report the bacteria had
been found on products in the same factory
in 2011 despite an obligation to do
so, a government official said on Tuesday.
Dozens of babies fell ill after drinking
baby milk contaminated with so-called
Salmonella Agona produced by Lactalis,
one of the world's largest dairy
groups, prompting the recall of 12 million
tins.
""There has been a lag between elements
given to inspection services and the selfchecks
that we have been able to recover
as part of the crisis,"" the head of the
French government's food department,
Patrick Dehaumont, told a Senate commission.
""Salmonella Agona had been found in
2009, 2014, one on products in 2011 and
other serotype in 2013 and 2014,"" he
added.
Lactalis Chief Executive Emmanuel
Besnier said earlier this month in an interview
that Salmonella Agona had been
found in the environment between 2005
and 2017, so it could not be excluded
that babies had consumed contaminated
milk over that period.
The company had made no public reference
to positive tests on products.
Lactalis spokesman Michel Nalet declined
to comment.
Companies in France must report to the
authorities tests that show salmonella in
a product. They are under no obligation
to do so for tests showing the bacteria
in the environment but must provide the
results if asked to do so.
Asked to confirm that positive Lactalis
self-checks had not been handed to the
authorities, he replied: ""That's it"".
""What's unfortunate, is that there was
no questioning by the company about
the fact that it was still amazing to find
a Salmonella Agona several times over
the years after it was found in 2005,""
Dehaumont said.
More than 200 babies in France have
been contaminated with Salmonella Agona

The products concerned in Spain are

Lactalis has been the target of heavy
criticism after it emerged that the company's
own tests found salmonella at the

PARIS, Feb 1 (Reuters) -
French dairy giant Lactalis is scrambling
to get on top of a growing crisis,
with dozens of babies infected with salmonella
after drinking tainted baby formula
produced by the company.
Following are details on the familyowned
group and the health scare that
has led to the threat of multiple lawsuits.
WHAT IS LACTALIS?
The privately held firm is the world's
largest producer of cheese and one of the
world's largest dairy groups.
Founded in Laval, southwest of Paris, in
1933, the company has expanded steadily
over generations of the Besnier family.
Its takeover of Italy's Parmalat in
2011 turned it into a major global player.
It now has 75,000 employees and 246
factories in 47 countries across Europe,
the Americas, Asia and Africa, and says
its annual sales are around 17.3 billion
euros ($21 billion).
Its most famous product is the President
brand of Camembert cheese.
The crisis has forced the famously private
company to try to be more transparent.
Chief Executive Emmanuel
Besnier, a 47-year-old who rarely shows
his face in public, has been forced to
give his first interviews since he took office
in 2000.
WHEN DID THE LATEST CRISIS BEGIN?
On Dec. 1, 2017, tests by the French
Health Ministry confirmed that 20 babies
had been contaminated by formula
produced at the Lactalis factory in
Craon, western France.
On Dec. 2, it issued a recall of 12 suspected
baby milk batches, followed by a
further recall of 625 batches on Dec. 12
and a third on Dec. 21.
Lactalis halted operations at the factory
on Dec. 8 and announced on Jan. 11 the
temporary layoff of 250 workers.
On Jan. 12, Lactalis said it would take
back all products ever produced at
Craon.
The recall concerns more than 12 million
baby milk tins in France and
abroad, from China to Algeria and
Spain. Lactalis said the recall targeted
83 countries in all.
On Feb. 1, Besnier said Lactalis could
have been producing salmonella-tainted
baby milk at Craon since 2005. He said
the crisis was likely to cost the company
hundreds of millions of euros.
HOW WAS THE MILK INFECTED? Last year's contaminations have been
linked to a salmonella outbreak in 2005
at the Craon plant, then owned by Celia,
which contaminated over 140 babies.
Lactalis took over Celia in 2006.
The salmonella is believed to have been
revived following work in the factory in
the first half of the year.
HOW HAS LACTALIS REACTED?
As well as the recalls and promising to
compensate affected families, it has said
it will permanently close the facility at
the Craon plant in which the salmonella
was discovered.
Besnier has questioned the effectiveness
of 16,000 tests performed by an unidentified
private laboratory last year that
had revealed nothing.
""If the analysis of end-products had revealed
the presence of Salmonella Agona,
we would of course not have marketed
the products and we would have
avoided the crisis,"" Lactalis said in a
statement.
It has pledged to reinforce controls on
baby milk products and have tests performed
by a second laboratory.
NUMBER AND LOCATION OF AFFECTED
BABIES
France's Institut Pasteur, the research
center that monitors salmonella, says
more than 200 babies have been contaminated
since 2005 with Salmonella
Agona, the bacteria found at Lactalis'
Craon factory.
Of these, 141 were contaminated in
2005, another 25 between 2006 and
2017, and 38 in the latest outbreak.
French health authorities have said 36
of the 38 cases last year were clearly
linked to Lactalis milk, as well as one in
Spain and a suspected one in Greece. A
group representing victims' families say
at least 10 more cases are unaccounted
for.
WHAT IS SALMONELLA?
The main symptoms of salmonella infection
are stomach ache and diarrhea,
which can lead to dehydration.
It can be life-threatening for infants or
people weakened by illness. Most
healthy people recover within a few
days without specific treatment.
LEGAL ACTION
Several families have already filed complaints
against Lactalis. Some are also
planning to take action against French
supermarket chains which were selling
recalled products despite the recall.
French supermarket chains Leclerc,
Auchan, Carrefour and Systeme U have
all acknowledged that some of the baby
milk remained on their shelves after the
recall.
Two complaints are already targeting
Auchan and Leclerc.
Class action lawsuits are not possible in
France. Each family must file a complaint
separately.
A group of victims said they would pursue
their legal complaints regardless of
any compensation offered.";Reuters

Besnier told French newspaper Les
Echos, adding it was possible the factory
was the source for these cases, and
others since.
In 2005, the factory in Craon was owned
by Celia, a company taken over by Lactalis
in 2006.
""It can not be excluded that babies have
consumed contaminated milk over this
period (2005-2017),"" Besnier said.
The Institut Pasteur, a French organisation
that monitors micro-organisms and
diseases, said more than 200 babies in
France had been contaminated with
""Salmonella Agona"" since 2005, including
38 between mid-August and December
last year, as well as 25 between 2006
and 2017 and 141 in 2005.
French health authorities have said 36
of the 38 cases last year were clearly
linked to Lactalis milk, as well as one in
Spain and a suspected one in Greece. A
group representing victims' families say
at least 10 more cases are unaccounted
for.
Besnier said Lactalis was permanently
closing one of its facilities at the Craon
plant due to the outbreak.
He also questioned the effectiveness of
16,000 tests performed by an unidentified
private laboratory last year that had
revealed nothing. ""If the analysis of end-products had revealed
the presence of Salmonella Agona,
we would of course not have marketed
the products and we would have
avoided the crisis,"" Lactalis said in a
statement, referring to the laboratory
tests.
The victims' association said it had read
Besnier's comments with ""dismay"".
""These are several hundred million boxes
concerned and several hundred thousand
tonnes of products sent to more
than 80 countries. This is a health scandal
of unprecedented scale,"" it said in a
statement.
""This implies that the victims could
have been much more numerous.""
Besnier said the scandal was ""the
biggest crisis I've ever had to face as a
boss.""
""We can't say definitively but (the cost)
will be very high, several hundred million
euros,"" he told Les Echos.
""This case could cost us our export licence
for a still undetermined period,""
he added.
Besnier did not give details of what the
costs would be.
He said a lot of the milk recalled since
early December had been consumed and
that returns were likely to amount to less
than half of total volumes.
French supermarket chains Leclerc,
Auchan, Carrefour and Systeme U have
all acknowledged that some of the baby
milk remained on their shelves after the
recall.
The victims' association's lawyer said
families intended to file lawsuits against
Auchan and Leclerc. Besnier said Lactalis
was the target of multiple legal
complaints.";Reuters

in 38 cases between mid-August and
December, 36 of them clearly linked to
Lactalis milk. A group representing victims'
families say at least 10 more cases
are unaccounted for.
Lactalis added in a statement that this
'Salmonella Agona' behind the 2017 infections
was the same as one behind cases
of infection in 2005, and that it was
stopping production at one of its facilities
at the Craon site due to the outbreak.
Besnier said that the company did not
know how much of the contaminated
milk had been consumed but less than
half of the recalled product had so far
been recovered.

Carrefour and Systeme U have all acknowledged
that some of the baby milk

The Institut Pasteur, which is France's

said the 25 cases were in addition

01/02/2018;Lactalis salmonella contamination 'may go back a decade';"Researchers raised
fears Thursday that salmonellatainted
milk produced by
French dairy giant Lactalis, which sickened
dozens of babies, could have infected
others over more than a decade.
Lactalis has been engulfed in scandal
since December when authorities ordered
a massive international recall of
the baby milk which made at least 38
babies ill in France and Spain.
The Pasteur research institute said
Thursday that the exact same strain of
salmonella sickened at least 25 others
between 2006 and 2016 -- and that the
same Lactalis factory in northwest
France was the likely origin.
Lactalis has been the target of heavy
criticism after it emerged that the company's
own tests found salmonella at the
factory in Craon, but it did not sound
the alarm because it had not detected the
bacteria in the milk itself.
That raised fears that contaminations
may have occurred well before last
year's discovery but gone undetected,
with critics pointing to an outbreak at
the same production site that sickened
146 children in 2005 -- before it was
bought by Lactalis a year later.

of Salmonella agona was behind the two
outbreaks, in 2005 and 2017,"" Pasteur

Lactalis has been engulfed in scandal since

recall of the baby milk which made at least
38 babies ill in France and Spain
Institute director Francois-Xavier Weill
told AFP.
""So we asked ourselves where the strain
could have been during the 12 years in
between"" those two scares, he said.
""The only possible hypothesis is that it
remained at the factory in question.""
Although the institute could not definitively
determine whether the sickened
babies drank Lactalis milk, ""the DNA
evidence is very clear, and it points to
this factory,"" Weill said.
Lactalis CEO Emmanuel Besnier confirmed
Thursday that tests between the
two outbreaks had found the same salmonella
at the factory, though not in the
milk.
""We can't exclude the possibility that
some babies drank contaminated milk
during this period,"" he admitted. The bacteria was found in a dehydration
tower used to reduce milk, which Lactalis
now plans to shut down for good,
Besnier told newspaper Les Echos.
- Lawsuits -
The company is facing several lawsuits
over the outbreak, and police raided the
group's headquarters in Laval, western
France, earlier this month.
It recalled 12 million packages of the affected
baby milk, under brands including
Picot, Milumel and Celia, across 83
countries.
Several retailers later admitted that they
had continued to sell the products even
after the recall was announced.
Investigators have opened a preliminary
inquiry for suspected fraud as well as
endangering health by failing to properly
execute the recall.
Salmonella causes fever and diarrhoea
in infants, along with vomiting in some
cases, which can lead to babies being
hospitalised for dehydration.

PARIS, Jan 26 (Reuters)
- Ten more babies have tested positive
for salmonella in France after drinking
milk produced by the firm Lactalis, a
group representing families said on Friday
Lactalis, one of the world's largest dairy
groups, has recalled 12 millions tins nationwide
and from stores around the
world after last month discovering salmonella
bacteria in some baby milk at a
factory in western France.
French authorities have said that ""Salmonella
Agona"" infections were reported
in 38 cases between mid-August and
December, 36 of them clearly linked to
Lactalis milk.
But Quentin Guillemain, president of
the Association of Families of Victims
Contaminated with Salmonella
(AFVLCS), told reporters there were ""at
least 10 families to this date not accounted
for"" whose children had tested
positive for salmonella after drinking
Lactalis milk.
Another case has been confirmed in
Spain and one is suspected in Greece.
The recalls have stretched as far as China.
President Emmanuel Macron addressed
the issue on Thursday, saying there
could be no tolerance for companies that
did not respect rules.
AFVLCS's lawyer, Jade Dousselin, said
she would file 10 legal complaints from
families at the end of next week, eight
against Lactalis, and two against the retailers
Leclerc and Auchan.
Leclerc, Auchan, Carrefour and Systeme

police raided the headquarters

Wednesday over a baby milk salmonella
scare that has sickened dozens of children
and led to a major international recall.
Dozens of police were searching the
company's offices in Laval, western
France, as well as its factory in nearby
Craon which was the source of the tainted
milk.
Lactalis has recalled baby milk from 83
countries, with anger growing after it
emerged that the company's own tests
had discovered salmonella at the Craon
site in August and November.
The company did not report the findings
and it says it had no legal obligation to
do so because it had not detected salmonella
in its products.
The contamination, found in a dehydration
tower used to reduce milk, was not
revealed to the public until December.
At least 37 babies in France are known
to have fallen sick and another in Spain,
while Greece has also seen one unconfirmed
case.
A source close to the probe said magistrates
and 70 police were raiding Lactalis
sites on Wednesday.

The raids come after Paris investigators
opened a preliminary inquiry on December
2 for suspected fraud as well as
endangering health by failing to properly
execute the recall.
Officers were guarding the factory
doors, an AFP photographer said, with
dozens of police vehicles on site.
At the company headquarters, investigators
from public health agency OCLAESP
and consumer protection agency
DGCCRF were searching the premises
alongside police.
The recall affects 12 million boxes of
powdered baby milk under brands including
Picot, Milumel and Celia.
The raids come after Paris investigators
opened a preliminary inquiry on December
2 for suspected fraud as well as endangering
health by failing to properly
execute the recall.
Lactalis CEO Emmanuel Besnier at the
weekend offered to compensate the affected

But an association of victims' families,

Dimanche newspaper -- his first interview
in nearly 20 years as head of the
family-controlled company.

PARIS, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Some French
families are planning to take legal action
against supermarket chains after potentially
tainted products found their way
onto shop shelves despite a recall, the
spokesman of a victims' group said on
Monday.
Quentin Guillemain also reiterated that
hundreds of families were suing French
dairy giant Lactalis over the scandal,
which threatens to damage the reputation
of France's strategic agri-business
industry in overseas markets.
Reacting to an offer by Lactalis of financial
compensation to affected families,
Guillemain said that they wanted above
all to find out the truth, adding that the
company would not be able to ""buy our
silence"".
Three dozen infants in France and two
others overseas have fallen ill since the
discovery of salmonella bacteria in
some baby milk at a factory in northwestern
France in early December that
prompted the botched recall. Salmonella
infections can be life-threatening.
""It's been confirmed to me that a certain
number of families will file complaints
in the coming days against the major supermarket
chains,"" Guillemain told reporters
after meeting Finance Minister
Bruno Le Maire and Health Minister
Agnes Buzyn.
Guillemain did not say how many families
would sue the retailers.
Last week the French government laid
the blame for the widening crisis over
salmonella contamination squarely on
both Lactalis, one of the world's largest
dairy groups, and on retailers.
Carrefour, Leclerc, Auchan and Systeme
U had said some baby milk recalled
by Lactalis had still made it onto
shop shelves.
French prosecutors have launched a judicial
investigation into the contamination.
PAYING DAMAGES
Lactalis has been accused of reacting
too slowly to the scandal. It is now recalling some 12 million tins of baby
milk, both in France and in foreign
countries as far as China.
Lactalis Chief Executive Emmanuel
Besnier gave a rare interview at the
weekend, offering to pay damages to
families affected by the contamination
scare.
Guillemain said the families would pursue
their legal complaints regardless of
any compensation offered by Lactalis.
""What families are expecting today is
not a private deal to drop their claims
but to have the truth on what happened,
from the beginning till the end. So the
question of compensation is not today's
question,"" Guillemain said.
""They will not buy our silence,"" he
added.
Families of victims in foreign countries
could also file complaints in France, he
said. One baby in Spain and one in
Greece are suspected of having been
contaminated by baby milk produced by
Lactalis.
""Since the infraction occurred on French
territory and the suspect - the Lactalis
group - has its headquarters in France,
the victims, whether they be Spanish,
Greek or Chinese, will be able to file a
complaint in France,"" the group's lawyer

December -- fell far short of expectations.
""We still don't know where they are, we

He said it also remained unclear when

suggesting it could have been
before 2017, the period initially covered
by the recall announced in December.

Quentin Guillemain, president of the
Lactalis victim's association, said the
explanations given by the Lactalis boss fell
far short of expectations
""It's a question we asked once again,
and as of now we have not had any response,""
said Guillemain, who has demanded
an apology from Lactalis.

tally of 37 children sickened by the
salmonella outbreak in France, saying
that without systematic testing of babies
brought to doctors, the true figure remains
unknown.

By Richard Lough
PARIS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - France welcomed
dairy group Lactalis' pledge to
compensate victims of a Salmonella
contamination in its baby milk on Sunday,
but said a judicial investigation to
determine who was responsible would
continue.
Lactalis Chief Executive Emmanuel
Besnier told the weekly Journal du Dimanche
his family company, one of the
world's biggest dairies, would ""pay
damages to every family which has suffered
a prejudice"".
Salmonella infections can be lifethreatening
and the families of three
dozen children who have fallen sick in
France as a result of the contaminated
baby milk have announced a raft of lawsuits.
Besnier's promise came two days after
Lactalis widened a product recall to cover
all infant formula made at its Craon
plan, regardless of the manufacture date,
in an bid to contain the fallout from a
health scare that risks damaging
France's strategic agribusiness in overseas
markets.
""Paying compensation is good, but money
cannot buy everything,"" government
spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said in
an interview on BFM TV.
The health scare intensified last week
after France's biggest retailers including
Carrefour, Auchan and Leclerc admitted
products recalled in December had still
found their way onto shelves.
""It is the job of the investigation to determine
where failings occurred and
who is to blame,"" Griveaux said, adding
that ""responsibilities were shared"".
Besnier did not say how much the damages
might amount to.
Implementing the global recall will be
challenging. Privately owned Lactalis,
one of the world's biggest dairies, exports
its baby food products to 83 countries
across Europe, Africa and Asia.
CLUMSY RESPONSE
The recall involves some 12 million tins
of baby milk.
""It's not easy to evaluate the number of
items that need to be returned because
we don't know what's been consumed already,"" Besnier said in a rare newspaper
interview published on Sunday.
Friday's recall was the third in a month
and Lactalis has come under fire for its
clumsy response. Besnier also told the
French weekly that the company had
acted as quickly and efficiently as possible
and denied slowing the process to
curb losses.
Besnier has also been criticised for failing
to speak out publicly during the salmonella
scare.
While his family are France's 11th
wealthiest, according to a 2017 ranking
by Challenges magazine, the dairy tycoon
has long shunned the public limelight
and schmoozing with politicians.
His workers nickname him the ""invisible
man.""
""We're a discreet business. In this region
there is a mentality of 'work first, speak
later,"" he said. But he acknowledged
lessons had been learned during the past
few weeks.
Lactalis has become an industry giant,
with annual sales of 17 billion euros
($20.73 billion) and 18,900 employees
across some 40 countries.
He said the Craon plant was likely to remain
closed for several months.
The recall risks damaging Lactalis in
China, a fast-growing market for baby
food and dairy products where scares after
melamine-tainted baby milk led to
the deaths of six children in 2008.
That scandal caused distrust in locally
produced infant formula and benefited
foreign suppliers such as Nestle,
Danone and Lactalis.";Reuters

Emmanuel Besnier, giving his first interview
in nearly 20 years as head of
the family-controlled company, told the
Journal du Dimanche newspaper that the
recall involved more than 12 million
packages of Picot, Milumel, Celia and
other brands of powdered baby milk.
""We are going to draw the lessons from
this crisis and set out an even stricter hygiene
framework, in collaboration with
the authorities,"" he said.
Asked why he had not publicly addressed
earlier parents' concerns as worries
about the outbreak intensified,
Besnier said: ""It's true, by nature I'm not
very forthcoming.""
""In a crisis like this, we act first, and
perhaps I didn't take the necessary time
to explain things.""
A total of 37 babies have fallen ill in
France as a result of the contamination,
health authorities said late Friday, along
with a case in Spain and a suspected
case in Greece.
But Besnier said no new cases had been
reported since December 8, a week after
the recall was announced.
The French government welcomed the
pledge to reimburse victims, but said investigations
would continue to determine
why the contamination went undetected.
Officials will also investigate why in
some cases the affected milk continued
to be distributed in supermarkets, pharmacies
and even some hospitals after the
recall was announced.
""When you have a case of milk on the
market which has clearly caused complicated
health problems for children, it
means at some point there was negligence,""
government spokesman Benjamin
Griveaux told BFM television
Sunday.
Besnier's explanations ""have not been
sufficient,"" he added, vowing that the investigations
""will not spare anyone"", including
the French state.
- 'Not hiding things' -
Besnier's interview with the newspaper
included two of the first public photographsof
the secretive leader in years,
at the Lactalis headquarters in Laval,
western France.
Created in 1933 by Besnier's grandfather,
Lactalis has become an industry
behemoth with annual sales of some 17
billion euros ($20.6 billion), making it
the world's third-largest dairy group, behind
Danone and Nestle. The interview came after French finance
minister Bruno Le Maire summoned
Besnier to a meeting over the crisis on
Friday, in which the chief executive
agreed to pull from store and pharmacy
shelves all products from the Craon factory
where the outbreak was found.
But Besnier did not appear with Le
Maire at a press conference after the
meeting, despite calls by several government
officials for him to face the
public.
Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed
against the group by families who say
their children got salmonella poisoning
after drinking powdered milk made by
the company.
Richard Ferrand, leader of President
Emmanuel Macron's LREM lawmakers
in parliament, said all efforts would be
made to find the causes of the crisis, and
did not rule out the creation of a parliamentary
inquiry, sought by opposition
groups.
But Besnier, 47, denied claims by an association
of victims' families that Lactalis
had lied about the dates and number
of stocks affected by the salmonella outbreak.
""At no point was there any intention of
hiding things,"" he said.
- 'Buy our silence' -
But the company's promise of compensation
did not impress Quentin Guillemain,
president of the Lactalis victim's
association.
""They are trying to buy our silence,"" he
told AFP.
""We want the truth,"" he added, berating
Lactalis for failing to provide apologies
or explanations.
""Mr Besnier speaks of 83 countries affected...
Where are these figures from?
Have all the authorities been informed?
We are waiting for answers,"" said
Guillemain.
Besnier meanwhile also defended the
decision not to inform the authorities
that internal tests had discovered salmonella
on a broom and on the tiles of
a dehydration tower at the company's
Craon factory in August and November
last year.
""For us, these 'environment' tests are an
alert to make sure we keep the bacteria
far from the product,"" he said, adding
that authorities would have been alerted
only if bacteria were found in the powdered
milk.
The salmonella scare has cast a harsh
spotlight on an executive and a company
little known to the public, despite employing
15,000 people in France, where
milk and cheese are proudly considered
part of the country's heritage.

Emmanuel Besnier, scion of the secretive
family behind one of the world's
biggest dairy groups, was speaking publicly
for the first time since an outcry
erupted over claims the company hid the
salmonella outbreak at a plant making
the product.
""We must take account the scale of this
operation: more than 12 million boxes
are affected,"" he said, adding that distributors
would no longer have to sort
through the produce to find the contaminated
powder. ""They know that everything
has to be removed from the
shelves,"" Besnier said.
Besnier, who was summoned to the
French finance ministry on Friday,
promised compensation for all the families
affected.
He said that the consequences of this
health crisis for consumers, including
babies under six months, were at the
forefront of his mind. ""It is for us, for
me, a great concern,"" he told the Journal
du Dimanche.
Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed
against the group by families who say
their children got salmonella poisoning
after drinking powdered milk made by
the company.
So far French officials have reported 35
cases of infants getting salmonella from
the powder, while one case has been reported
in Spain and another is being investigated
in Greece.
An association representing victims
says the authorities are underestimating
the number of cases.
""There are complaints and there will be
an investigation with which we will fully
collaborate. We never thought to act
otherwise,"" Besnier said.
Created in 1933 by Besnier's grandfather,
Lactalis has become an industry
behemoth with annual sales of some 17
billion euros ($20.6 billion), with products
including Galbani ricotta and mozzarella
in Italy.
With 246 production sites in 47 countries,
its list of products also features
household names like President butter
and Societe roquefort.
Two of those brands, Picot and Milumel
baby milk, were the subject of chaotic
international recalls issued in mid-
December after dozens of children fell
sick.
The scandal deepened this month when
French investigative weekly Le Canard
Enchaine reported that state inspectors
had given a clean bill of health to the Lactalis site in Craon, northwest France,
in early September.
They failed to find the salmonella bacteria
that had been detected by Lactalis's
own tests in August and November,
which were not reported to the authorities.
The company said it was not legally
bound to report the contamination.";AFP
14/01/2018;Embattled French dairy chief breaks silence over salmonella scare;"The
chief executive of France's
Lactalis group on Sunday
vowed compensation for victims of salmonella-
tainted baby milk, as he revealed
that recalls were now under way
in 83 countries.
Emmanuel Besnier, giving his first interview
in nearly 20 years as head of
the family-controlled company, told the
Journal du Dimanche newspaper that the
recall involved more than 12 million
packages of Picot, Milumel, Celia and
other brands of powdered baby milk.
""We are going to draw the lessons from
this crisis and set out an even stricter hygiene
framework, in collaboration with
the authorities,"" he said.
Asked why he had not publicly addressed
parents' concerns as worries
about the outbreak intensified, Besnier
said: ""It's true, by nature I'm not very
forthcoming.""
""In a crisis like this, we act first, and
perhaps I didn't take the necessary time
to explain things.""
A total of 37 babies have fallen ill in
France as a result of the contamination,
health authorities said late Friday, along
with a case in Spain and a suspected
case in Greece, but Besnier said no new
cases had been reported since December
8, a week after the recall was announced.
The French government welcomed the
pledge to reimburse victims, but said investigations
would continue to determine
why the contamination went undetected.
Officials will also investigate why in
some cases the affected milk continued
to be distributed in supermarkets, pharmacies
and even some hospitals after the
recall was announced.
""Compensation is good, but money can't
buy everything,"" government
spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told
BFM television Sunday.
""When you have a case of milk on the
market which has clearly caused complicated
health problems for children, it
means at some point there was negligence,""
Griveaux said.
Besnier's explanations ""at this point""
have not been sufficient, he added, vowing
that the investigations ""will not
spare anyone"", including the French
state.
- 'Not hiding things' -
Besnier's interview included two of the
first public photographs of the secretive
leader in years, at the Lactalis headquarters
in Laval, western France It came after French finance minister
Bruno Le Maire summoned Besnier to a
meeting over the crisis Friday, in which
the chief executive agreed to pull from
store and pharmacy shelves all products
from the Craon factory where the outbreak
was found, instead of just those
dating back to February.
But Besnier did not appear with Le
Maire at a press conference after the
meeting, despite calls by several government
officials for him to face the
public.
Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed
against the group by families who say
their children got salmonella poisoning
after drinking powdered milk made by
the company.
Richard Ferrand, leader of President
Emmanuel Macron's LREM lawmakers
in parliament, said all efforts would be
made to find the causes of the crisis, and
did not rule out the creation of a parliamentary
inquiry, sought by opposition
groups.
But Besnier, 47, denied claims by an association
of victims' families that Lactalis
had lied about the dates and number
of stocks affected by the salmonella outbreak.
""This is false. I don't know what this
claim is based on,"" he said.
""At no point was there any intention of
hiding things.""
- Harsh spotlight -
Besnier also defended the decision not
to inform the authorities that internal
tests had discovered salmonella on a
broom and on the tiles of a dehydration
tower at the company's Craon factory in
August and November last year.
""For us, these 'environment' tests are an
alert to make sure we keep the bacteria
far from the product,"" he said, adding
that authorities would have been alerted
only if bacteria were found in the powdered
milk.
Created in 1933 by Besnier's grandfather,
Lactalis has become an industry
behemoth with annual sales of some 17
billion euros ($20.6 billion), making it
the world's third-largest dairy group, behind
Danone and Nestle.
The salmonella scare has cast a harsh
spotlight on an executive and a company
little known to the public, despite employing
15,000 people in France, where
milk and cheese are proudly considered
part of the country's heritage.
Analysts say the crisis could dent the
company's reputation among anxious
parents worldwide.
""This recall may undermine consumer
trust in milk formula brands produced
using milk from French farms in the
emerging markets affected by the recall,
which includes China,"" said Raphael
Moreau, a senior analyst at Euromonitor.";AFP

quotes, context)
By Richard Lough and Gus Trompiz
PARIS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - French dairy
group Lactalis is widening a product recall
to cover all baby milk manufactured
by a factory at the centre of a salmonella
contamination, Finance minister Bruno
Le Maire said on Friday.
The move comes as the government
seeks to contain reputational damage to
France's strategic agri-business industry
in overseas markets. Three dozen children
have fallen ill in France and at least
one other in Spain.
After talks with Lactalis management
Le Maire said the company would recall
all infant formula milk products made at
its Craon factory that were still in warehouses
and on store shelves, regardless
of the date of manufacture.
""The aim of this radical step is simple:
to avoid delays, problems in sorting
batches and the risk of human error,"" Le
Maire told a news conference on Friday.
In a later statement Lactalis confirmed
the extended recall and pledged to find
and eradicate the causes of the salmonella
contamination.
Implementing the recall will be challenging.
Privately owned Lactalis exports
its products to dozens of countries
across Europe, Africa and Asia.
The tough measure reflects high-level
frustration at the botched handling of the
crisis after France's biggest supermarkets
-- including Carrefour, Auchan and
Leclerc -- this week said that some Lactalis
products subject to recalls in December
still found their way onto their
shelves.
It has been particularly embarrassing for
the government after President Emmanuel
Macron pushed food exports
during a state visit to China this week.
Salmonella infections can be lifethreatening,
particularly for young children,
and the recall risks damaging Lactalis
in China. Consumers in China, a
fast-growing market for baby food and
dairy products, are particularly sensitive
to such scares after melamine-tainted
baby milk led to the deaths of six children
in 2008.
That scandal caused distrust in locally
produced infant formula and benefited
foreign suppliers such as Nestle,
Danone and Lactalis. ""I cannot guarantee that right now there
isn't a single tin of baby milk left on a
shelf in a giant warehouse or in a pharmacy,""
Le Maire said. ""I think this (further
recall) is the strongest guarantee we
can give.""
Le Maire did not say what volume of baby
milk could be involved beyond the
more than 12 million items already recalled
last month.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention
and Control said on Jan. 5 that
one infant in Spain had fallen ill with
a salmonella infection linked to contaminated
Lactalis baby milk and another
case in Greece was thought to be related.
A judicial investigation is taking place
in France over the contamination and a
group of French parents of affected infants
said on Friday that they were considering
a joint lawsuit.";Reuters
12/01/2018;Salmonella scandal casts harsh light on France's secretive dairy giant;"Emmanuel
Besnier, scion of the secretive
family behind one of the
world's biggest dairy groups, is often
called ""the invisible billionaire"", unknown
to the French public and even to
his own employees.
But an outcry over claims the company
hid a salmonella outbreak at a plant
making powdered baby milk earned him
a summons to the French finance ministry
on Friday, a rare test for a CEO
who rarely shows his face in public.
Created in 1933 by Besnier's grandfather,
Lactalis has become an industry
behemoth with annual sales of some 17
billion euros ($20.6 billion), making
twarog, or quark, in eastern Europe,
kaymak in Serbia and Galbani ricotta
and mozzarella in Italy.
With 246 production sites in 47 countries,
its list of products stretches as long
as a supermarket aisle, including household
names like President butter and Societe
roquefort.
Two of those brands, Picot and Milumel
baby milk, were the subject of chaotic
international recalls issued in mid-
December after dozens of children fell
sick.

other products made by Lactalis, the French
dairy giant, on a wall of its headquarters in
Laval, western France
A total of 35 children in France have
fallen ill from the salmonella contamination,
prompting a company
spokesman, Michel Nalet, to ""apologise
once again to parents"" on Thursday.
French health authorities said Friday
that a child in Spain had also fallen ill
after drinking Lactalis baby milk, while
another case is being investigated in
Greece.
Nalet also said that Lactalis was working
""in perfect collaboration"" with
French officials to contain the outbreak,
a claim that was rebuffed by France's increasingly
exasperated economy minister,
Bruno Le Maire, on Friday.
""If there had been perfect collaboration,
I wouldn't have had to sign an order
on December 9 demanding the recall of more than 600 shipments of baby milk,""
Le Maire told French television.
Agriculture minister Stephane Travert
told RTL radio that he hoped Besnier
would address the contamination publicly
after his meeting with finance ministry
officials.
""I think that is what our fellow citizens
expect,"" he said.
- 'Nobody ever sees him' -
The fact that Besnier was named head of
the group when he was just 29 years old
may have reinforced his desire to stay
out of the media spotlight.
Now aged 47, even the few media photos
of him that exist date from more than
10 years ago.
But anger over the salmonella scandal
and claims that Lactalis poorly handled
the subsequent recalls may force him to
address the mistrust personally.
The scandal deepened this month when
French investigative weekly Le Canard
Enchaine reported that state inspectors
had given a clean bill of health to the
Lactalis site in Craon, northwest France,
in early September.
They failed to find the salmonella bacteria
that had been detected by Lactalis's
own tests in August and November,
which were not reported to the authorities.
The company said it was not legally
bound to report the contamination, and
it was only after children started falling
sick that inspectors descended on the
Craon plant.
It could now face charges of causing involuntary
injuries and endangering people's
lives.
""Lactalis should understand that transparency
is the best security these days,
and it should have taken the necessary
decisions"" sooner, Le Maire said Friday.
But it seems unlikely that Besnier,
whose group has paid fines for failing
to publish detailed financial data in the
past, will change its ways anytime soon.
""His grandfather went to each farm,
knew every producer. Him, nobody ever
sees him!"" said Philippe Jehan, president
of the FDSEA agriculture union for
the Mayenne region, home of Lactalis's
headquarters.
""Personally, in over 20 years of working
in the department, I've never once met
him.""
- Growing mistrust -
Media investigations over the years
have uncovered employees who ""don't
even know what he looks like"", while
government officials are also hard
pressed to secure a meeting with the
head of the company that employs
15,000 people.
Stephane Le Foll, agriculture minister
in ex-president Francois Hollande's government,
said he ""never"" met with Emmanuel
Besnier during his five-year
term.
Even when attending matches for the
Stade Lavallois football club in the company's
hometown of Laval, financed
largely by Lactalis, Besnier arrives after
the start and leaves before the end -- and
watches from behind the darkened glass
of a private skybox.
Such secrecy has hardly helped the
group's image with the public.
With its dominating market position,
Lactalis is regularly accused of driving
down wholesale prices for milk to the
point where producers can barely cover
their costs -- while refusing to budge
during bitter negotiations.
Its hardline attitude during the most recent
pricing standoff late last year
prompted the government to organise
talks to break the impasse, which wound
up in December.
""Lactalis plays up its use of French milk
and its know-how in its advertising, but
it pays us the same price for our milk as
it pays in India,"" one farmer from Britany
said at the time.";AFP
12/01/2018;'Hundreds' of lawsuits filed over Lactalis salmonella: association;"Hundreds of lawsuits
have been filed against
French dairy giant Lactalis by
families who say their children got salmonella
poisoning after drinking powdered
milk made by the company, an association
representing victims said Friday.
The announcement came as economy
minister Bruno Le Maire said Lactalis
would have to extend its product recall
to all milk products at the affected production
site.
""I've filed a lawsuit. Hundreds of other
families have already filed suits across
France,"" said the association's president
Quentin Guillemain during a press conference.
""Several hundreds more want to file
suit, and will do so in the coming days,""
he said.
So far French officials have reported 35
cases of children getting salmonella poisoning
from the contaminated milk
powder, while one case has been reported
in Spain and another is being investigated
in Greece.
Asked about the discrepancy between
the reported cases and the number of
lawsuits, Guillemain said he believed
the authorities were underestimating the
number of cases.
""Unfortunately we have not been able to
compare our own figures"" with those of
DAMIEN MEYER
There have been reports of 35 French
children getting salmonella poisoning after
drinking contaminated milk powder made by
diary giant Lactalis
health authorities, he said, ""and today I
can't tell you how many victims there
are exactly"".
He estimated that ""tens of millions of
cans"" of powdered baby milk, exported
to 66 countries, may have been contaminated
by the salmonella outbreak discovered
in December at Lactalis's site in
Craon, northwest France.
Le Maire announced the extended recall
after meeting with the company's chief
executive Emmanuel Besnier, saying he
had asked the company to ""make an effort
at more transparency"".
Besnier himself did not make a statement,
as several officials have pressed
him to do given the public alarm and
chaotic recall efforts so far.
Health inspectors have discovered, for
example, that several retailers, including
supermarkets and pharmacies, had continued to keep the affected products on
their shelves despite the recall order.
On Thursday, a spokesman for Lactalis,
Michel Nalet, apologised once again to
parents, adding that the firm was working
""in perfect collaboration"" with
French officials to contain the outbreak.
The claim was rebuffed by Le Maire,
who told French television: ""If there had
been perfect collaboration, I wouldn't
have had to sign an order on December
9 demanding the recall of more than 600
shipments of baby milk"".

Lactalis contaminated with Salmonella
bacteria has been reported in Spain and

Greece, French health authorities said
Friday.
The cases are the first outside of France
in a gathering scandal that has seen 35
children sickened in France from contaminated
milk powder sold by the maker
of a host of household dairy products.
""The two cases involved children who
drank the milk in question,"" said
François-Xavier Weill, a bacteriologist
at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, confirming
a report in the Eurosurveillance
medical journal.
The Spanish case had been confirmed
with DNA testing, Weill told AFP.
""The Greek case has not, but the signs
are there,"" he said, adding that so far
only phenotype testing had been carried
out to compare the bacteria strain of the
Lactalis product with the strain in the
child.
""We can only confirm if it is the same
strain with DNA testing"" currently underway,
he said.
The current conditions of the two children
were not disclosed.
The Eurosurveillance report, signed by
16 scientists at the Pasteur Institute as
well as France's public health agency,
notes that the contaminated Lactalis
products were exported ""to 66 countries,
including 12 in the European Union"".
Alerts were issued for the concerned
countries in early December, after
French inspectors descended on Lactalis's
Craon factory where the outbreak
was traced to.

been reported, and among the 18 who
were hospitalised, all have been released

said.";AFP
11/01/2018;French retailers sold Lactalis baby milk after salmonella recall;"France's biggest supermarket
chains said they sold some
Lactalis baby food products after a recall
by the dairy giant over concerns
they could be contaminated with salmonella.
Retailers Carrefour, Leclerc, Auchan
and Systeme U independently said products
including infant formula remained
on their shelves after the recall last December.
The product recall affected goods destined
for French and overseas markets
carrying the Picot, Milumel and Taranis
brands and France's consumer protection
agency DGCCRF has begun an investigation
and carried out more than
2,000 checks so far.
""We made mistakes, as did all the big
distribution companies,"" Systeme U
spokesman Thierry Desouches told
BFM TV, adding that the recall had been
complex and it had done all it could to
carry it out quickly.
""We're speaking about a volume of
products that perhaps earned us a total
margin of 300 euros. Would we risk our
image for such a derisory amount?""
Desouches said on Thursday.
The DGCCRF issued a first recall on
Dec. 10 after Lactalis discovered salmonella
contamination at its Craon factory,
halting the sale of several baby food
products made there.
Products from the Craon plant are suspected
by consumer protection authorities
of being linked to cases of salmonella
infection among infants in France.
Lactalis announced an extension to the
recall less than two weeks later, confirming
that contamination occurred at
Craon during work in the first half of the
year.
In a statement on Thursday, Carrefour
said it had sold 434 products at risk of
contamination since the Dec. 21 recall,
but that another 95,000 had been successfully
removed from shelves.
Leclerc, France's biggest food retailer,
said it had sold 984 products involved in
the recall.
The recall included products for export,
including to China, Taiwan, Pakistan,
Afghanistan, Iraq, Morocco, Lebanon,
Sudan, Romania, Serbia, Georgia,
Greece, Haiti, Colombia and Peru.
Some were also destined for regional
markets, including Africa and Asia.

to be punished.
Lactalis, one of the world's largest producers
of dairy products, in December
issued a recall of all products made at
its factory in Craon, northwest France,

bear the responsibility,"" French Agriculture
Minister Stephane Travert told a
news conference.
Supermarket chain Carrefour said
Wednesday it had sold 434 boxes of baby
milk produced by Lactalis that
should have been withdrawn and

Industrial leaders, intermediaries and retailers
must now ""shed all possible light
on the failings that they discovered and
assure us that none of the products concerned
are still on the market or in
stores,"" Travert said.

set ""while we have not exactly and precisely
identified the source of the contamination,
and before it has not been
clearly identified and removed,"" Travert
said.

Thursday that the anti-fraud unit DGCCRF
would undertake 2,500 additional
checks next week.
He also summoned retail industry leaders
to his ministry later on Thursday, and said he would meet on Friday with
Lactalis managers who had been ""found
lacking"".
""The state... had to take over from a
company that failed to act, one which
is solely responsible for the quality and
safety of its products,"" Le Maire said.
But on Thursday Lactalis spokesman
Michel Nalet said the company had
""worked in perfect collaboration with
state agencies"" since the start of the crisis
in December.
The firm also apologised again to parents
of the children who have fallen ill.
The head of the Leclerc supermarket
chain, Michel-Edouard Leclerc, also
looked to pin blame on French ""state
services"".
""The new situation confirms that the
failure is systemic and not just sectorwide,""
he said on his blog on Thursday.

is required, then there will be punishment"".

Macron also said that ""yes, the French
state is able to ensure food security"",
adding that he had himself asked his finance
minister to summon industry representatives.
Last week, a report said that French food
safety inspectors failed to detect salmonella
contamination at the Lactalis facility
three months before the company
carried out the recall.

carried out a routine inspection of
the site in September and gave it a clean

contamination at the Craon site,
which produces one of the Dutch product's
ingredients.
Salmonella symptoms include severe diarrhoea,
stomach cramps and vomiting.
The illness -- caused by intestinal bacteria
from farm animals -- is especially dangerous for the very young and elderly
because it can cause severe dehydration.
The baby milk industry was shaken by a
huge scare in China in 2008 when local
manufacturers were found to be bulking
their product with an industrial chemical.
Six babies died and around 300,000 others
were made ill.
The scare in the vast and growing Chinese
market benefited rival companies
such as Lactalis and fellow French giant
Danone, which were more expensive
but were seen by consumers as safe and
high quality.
- 16 babies hospitalised -
A total of 35 infants have fallen sick
with salmonella poisoning in France
since August including 16 who were
hospitalised, an unusually high number
that sparked fears of an epidemic.
Of these, 31 were found to have consumed
Lactalis products from its factory
in Craon, which was shut down on December
8 for a major cleaning.
The company believes the salmonella
outbreak can be traced to an evaporation
tower used to dry out the milk at the factory
it acquired in 2006.
The plant had suffered salmonella contamination
the previous year.
Quentin Guillemain, the father of a
three-month-old baby who drank the
milk but did not fall ill, has filed a complaint
against Lactalis and the UFC Que
Choisir consumer association announced
plans to do so.
Guillemain has set up a support group
for the families of infants sickened by
the milk.

in Paris specialised in public health

21/12/2017;"Lactalis extends baby product recall after finding contamination
source";"* Further 720 batches being recalled
* Concerns products made at Craon factory
(Adds detail)
PARIS, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Dairy giant
Lactalis announced on Thursday a further
recall of baby food products after
establishing a source of contamination
at a French factory which has been
linked to cases of salmonella bacteria.
Lactalis said it was recalling as a precaution
all infant formula and other baby
food products made at its factory in
Craon, northwest France, since Feb. 15,
which would represent 720 batches in
addition to more than 600 batches already
concerned by recent withdrawals.
The latest recall affected products destined
for both French and overseas markets
carrying the Picot, Milumel and
Taranis brands, Lactalis said in a statement.
Products supplied by the Craon plant are
suspected of being linked to recent cases
of salmonella infection among infants in
France.
After an initial recall at the start of this
month, checks by Lactalis did not indicate
any contamination. But the discovery
of more cases of salmonella then led
it to halt production at the Craon plant.
Lactalis said further tests had shown that
contamination occurred at Craon following
work in the first half of the year.
It did not indicate the type of contamination
detected.
Privately held Lactalis is one of the
world's largest dairy companies, reporting
annual sales of around 17 billion euros
($20.2 billion).
It has been expanding its infant nutrition
activity although its biggest categories
are cheese and liquid milk.";Reuters
21/12/2017;New recall of Lactalis baby milk over salmonella fears;"French baby-milk maker Lactalis
on Thursday ordered the
recall of all of the production of one of
its factories since February over fears of
possible contamination with salmonella.
Lactalis, one of the world's top dairy
producers, had already recalled around
7,000 tonnes of infant formula milk two
weeks ago.
But in what it described as ""a precautionary
measure"" on Thursday, it had
now decided -- in consultation with the
health authorities -- to recall ""all infant
formula and nutritional products manufactured
and conditioned in the Craon
factory"" in north western France.
""Information received from the health
authorities as well as the results of initial
investigations carried out... led the
group to issue a second recall, this time
of all products manufactured since February
15, 2017 using a specific drying
tower at the factory,"" the statement said.
The latest recall involves 720 batches
of products sold in France and overseas,
compared with the initial recall of 625
batches on December 10.
It concerned powders and infant cereals
of the group's Picot and Milumel brands,
as well as the Taranis powdered aminoacid
mix, the company said.
""We now know that there has been a
low-level dispersed contamination within
Craon factory, due to work during the
first 2017 semester,"" it explained.
The Craon site was shut down on December
8 ""for a thorough and comprehensive
audit,"" it added.
On Monday, the health authorities said
that 23 infants had been identified as
having drunk formula milk produced at
Craon and who had caught salmonellosis.
Around a dozen of the infants had been
hospitalised, but had subsequently been
discharged and were ""doing well"", the
authorities said.
The father of one three-month-old baby,
who drank the milk, and the UFC Que
Choisir consumer association, said
Monday they had filed a complaint
against Lactalis.
- 'Very sensitive products' -
By recalling all of the factory's production,
Lactalis was applying ""the principle
of maximum precaution,"" said Jehan
Moreau, director of the French National
Federation of Dairy Industries or FNIL.
""Infant milks are very sensitive products
and no risks should be taken. But it's
a terrible decision for them, because it
will constitute a huge shortfall,"" Moreau
told AFP.
Salmonellosis is a food poisoning that
ranges from mild gastroenteritis to more
serious infections. It is potentially more dangerous for young children, the elderly
or weak.
The health ministry asked parents ""not
to use, where possible"", the products
concerned.
In the worst case, pediatricians recommend
boiling the milk for two minutes.
Lactalis has set up a 24-hour helpline for
consumers.
""We wish to extend our sincerest apologies
to the families affected.We are well
aware of the seriousness of the situation
and fully understand the anxiety and inconvenience
that have been caused,"" it
said in a statement.";AFP

shipped worldwide
* Recall includes export products for
China, Africa, LatAm
PARIS, Dec 10 (Reuters) - France has
ordered banned the sale and ordered a
recall of several baby formula milk and
baby food products made by French
dairy giant Lactalis after the discovery
of salmonella bacteria, consumer protection
agency DGCCRF said in a statement.
The recall includes products for export,
including to China, Taiwan, Pakistan,
Afghanistan, Iraq, Morocco, Lebanon,
Sudan, Romania, Serbia, Georgia,
Greece, Haiti, Colombia and Peru.
Some were also destined for regional
markets, including Africa and Asia.
The agency said that Lactalis, the
world's largest dairy company, had not
managed contamination risk and has
been ordered to conduct a product recall
and halt the sale and export of several
baby food products made at its Craon
plant in western France since Feb. 15.
The recall follows 20 cases of salmonella
infection of infants in France during
early December, which had already
prompted a limited recall of 12 Lactalis
products.
This week five new cases were reported
of infection with the ""salmonella agona""
bacteria. One of the infants had consumed
a Lactalis product that had not
been on the first recall list. The infants
have now recovered, the agency said.
Lactalis spokesman Michel Nalet said
on BFM Television that the products can
be exchanged in pharmacies or supermarkets.
